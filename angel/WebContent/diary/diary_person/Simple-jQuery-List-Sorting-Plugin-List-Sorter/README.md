listSorter
==========

A jQuery plugin to sort a list just like jquery tablesorter plugin does.

jquery.tablesorter.js [http://tablesorter.com] is an awesome plugin to sort the table. Thanks to Christian Bach https://twitter.com/lovepeacenukes 

I was using this plugin and life was good, but then, in one of my projects the data in tables grew exponentially which started affecting the performance. It was decided that we should ditch the tables altogether and use lists instead. Using a list instead of table was a good idea, it improved the performance, but we were not able to sort the columns anymore as jquery.tablesorter works only on tables.

So I decided to create a separate plugin to sort the lists which look like tables.
